# David-Bowman-Portfolio

## My first attempt at building a portfolio page that I will continue to modify and trick out using new coding methods.

This is an example of a project I build with the assistance of what I am learning in my Austin Full Stack Bootcamp and Udemy and YouTube tutorials.  I used HTML, CSS and a little bit of Bootstrap.
